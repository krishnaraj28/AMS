Alumni are valuable assets for any educational institution. We have designed a centralized alumni management system. An alumni management system is used by educational institutes to maintain and manage records of alumni in an efficient manner. The project uses PHP/MySQL as the technology platform and has two user interfaces: the admin interface for the institution and the alumnus/alumna interface for the alumni themselves. The system allows alumni to register, manage, and update their personal and professional information. The system also enables the institutions to access and analyze the alumni data.
An alumni management system is a software platform designed to help educational institutions and organizations maintain connections with their former students, or alumni. It provides a centralized platform for managing and organizing alumni data, facilitating communication, and fostering engagement between alumni and the institution.
